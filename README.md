Vim Configuration

This configuration file is designed to enhance usability and productivity in Vim. It includes settings for better indentation, search behavior, and overall editor functionality. Here's what it does:
Features:

    General Settings:
        Disables compatibility mode (set nocompatible).
        Displays line numbers (set nu).
        Shows partial commands in the status line (set showcmd).
        Enables syntax highlighting (syntax on) and filetype-specific plugins (filetype plugin indent on).

    Indentation:
        Sets tab width to 2 spaces (set tabstop=2).
        Auto-indentation also uses 2 spaces (set shiftwidth=2).
        Converts tabs into spaces (set expandtab).

    Backspace Behavior:
        Allows backspace to work more flexibly over indentation, line breaks, and inserted text (set backspace=indent,eol,start).

    Search Improvements:
        Highlights all search results (set hlsearch).
        Enables incremental search (set incsearch) to show matches as you type.
        Makes searches case-insensitive by default but case-sensitive if uppercase letters are included (set ignorecase, set smartcase).

How to Use:

    Copy the provided configuration into your ~/.vimrc file.
